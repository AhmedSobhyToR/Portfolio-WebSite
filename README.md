I am a self-motivated person who is willing to go above and beyond on any project, and to learn valuable 
skills on my own time. I can find my niche within a group and support everyone's efforts. My 3 years in 
FCAI involved a lot of team projects. I was always able to recognize my teammates’ skills and delegated 
tasks that fit each person’s skills.

Technical Skills:
• Advanced Data Structures (e.g., red-black tree, interval tree, suffix tree).
• Algorithms (e.g., hashing, backtracking, sorting algorithms, greedy, graphs).
• Well understanding of solid principles and design patterns.
• UML (e.g., class diagram, sequence diagram).
• Designing an ERD and implementing databases using MS SQL Server.
• Dealing with a range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and Python.

Other Skills:
• Data Compression (Image compression using vector quantization and text compression).
• Computer Graphics (C++).
• High Performance Computing (MPI, C, OpenMP).
• Artificial Intelligence (Building an agent using mini-max or alpha-beta algorithms).
